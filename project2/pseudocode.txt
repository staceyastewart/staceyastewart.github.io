Pages I want to have:

>>Login page
>>Signup page
>>Home page
Page with all boroughs listed:
  When you click on each, it should hit the API and list out all courts in that borough
  Page with online bookable courts to redirect to NYC site
Forums:
  Singles
  Doubles
  On forum home page:
    option of creating a new post or searching through posts
Page that has permit costs for each level (hit API)





UP NEXT:
  View posts by topic (i.e. /all/sinlges /all/doubles /all/other)
  Figure out delete comments
  user's homepage with their posts listed
  should maybe add a username to each user that signs up

  url: /comments
  method: post
  data: stuff in your form
    hint: hidden field for post id
  success: function(){
