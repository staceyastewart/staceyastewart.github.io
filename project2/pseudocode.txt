Pages I want to have:

Page with all boroughs listed:
  When you click on each, it should hit the API and list out all courts in that borough
  Page with online bookable courts to redirect to NYC site
Forums:
  Singles
  Doubles
  On forum home page:
    option of creating a new post or searching through posts
Page that has permit costs for each level (hit API)



view posts ---> /partners/all
  --view by topic (i.e. /all/sinlges /all/doubles /all/other)
